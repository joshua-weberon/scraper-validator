# Scraper Validator Tool

A Tool to validate the scraped data manually. It takes csv as input and renders UI as per the data in the csv. The csv contains the data scraped by the scraper. UI renders the data and provides an interface to the user to validate the data. The validation options available are 'Good' or 'Bad'; if the data is bad the user must provide the correct value. Once whole data is validated, and there were some bad records, a csv with invalid data can be downloaded at the end.
